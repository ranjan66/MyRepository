Application Design
Angular 6
The Components Created are

CustomersComponent : This Component Is to Display the List of Customers

CustomerdetailsComponent : This Component Displays the Details for a Single Selected Customer

/customers : This url displays the customer list and points to CustomersComponent

/customerdetails/id : This url displays the details for each customer and points to CustomerdetailsComponent

Springboot 2
The package com.example.demo has the DemoApplication.java file which ensures that the application runs in an embedded container and forms the starting point of the code

The package com.example.dao.impl has the DAO ( Data Access Object ) Defined. The package com.example.dao has the interfaces defined for the DAOs. The DAO( Data Access Object ) connects to the DataBase and gets the necessary data

The package com.example.service.impl has the Services Defined . The package com.example.service has the interfaces defined for the Services. The Service is where the business logic is run on the Data which comes from DAO

The package com.example.controller has the Rest Controller defined. The controller has all the end points defined and mentions which function should be executed when an end point is called. The Controller also defines which Endpoint Calls which Service

The package com.example.models has all the java models defined

The application.properties file is used to define various properties such as the port in which the embedded container runs , the context path of the application etc

Postman Collection
Import the postman collections from postman folder into Postman. This postman collection has all the REST endpoints which are implemented in springboot.
